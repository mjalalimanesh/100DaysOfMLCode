### Day 1 : Perceptron Linear Classifier with NumPy
A **Perceptron** is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  

### Day 2 : Average Perceptron Linear Classifier with NumPy
A **Averaged Perceptron** is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  
The average perceptron algorithm uses the same rule to update parameters but The final returning values of θ and θ₀  are the average of all the values of θ and θ₀ in each step.

### Day 3 : Pegasos Linear Classifier with NumPy
A **Pegasos** is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  
The pegasos algorithm has the hyperparameter λ, giving more flexibility to the model to be adjusted. 

### Day 4 : Compare Perceptron, Average Perceptron and Pegasos
Comparison between the convergence of  perceptron, average perceptron, and pegasos linear classifiers on a toy dataset

### Day 5 : Food Review Sentiment Analysis with NumPy
Sentiment analysis of a food review dataset with bag-of-words model using pegasos classifier. Most positive and negative explainatory words are shown.
